let's use the most secure thing humans have ever create to improve and solve user security
--
What do I mean by security?
  integrity
  authenticity

1) how do I know what landed on my machine is the same thing as I meant to download?
2) how do I know that what landed on my machine is authentic (meaning signed by the developer)
--
As a developer, I would package my content, compute a checksum, and digitally sign the package.
Then provide all of this information, as well as instructions on how to verify the data, on the download page of my webserver.
--
As an end user, I want to securely install a file:
I go to download the file, which shows a checksum, a public key, and a digital signature.
which you can think of as a hash of the contents of the file
and a signature, which you all understand means the developer signed off on this release.
This isn't that complicated, but requires extra effort on the user's part.

And we all know what that means.
--
How might we go about doing this on Bitcoin?
We need several ingredients before we can make this happen:
I vanity mine an address and prepopulate it with some unspent UTXOs.
--
Now, as a developer, I package my content and run my application. This results in an on chain trasnaction.
--
As a user, I compute a checksum, then check the blockchain. If I see a transaction
from the company's special address, I know this software is valid.
--
The fact that this transaction exists on chain requires that I signed it.
